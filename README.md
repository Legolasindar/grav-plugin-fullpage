# Fullpage Plugin Demo Content

The **Fullpage** Plugin is for [Grav CMS](http://github.com/getgrav/grav). The [Fullpage](https://github.com/OleVik/grav-plugin-fullpage)-plugin provides a simple way of creating fullscreen slideshows that can be navigated vertically and horizontally, using the [fullPage.js](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js)-library.

A [demo is available](https://olevik.me/plugins/fullpage/book/), as are docs presented [by the plugin](https://olevik.me/plugins/fullpage/). This branch holds copies of the pages used in these two examples.
